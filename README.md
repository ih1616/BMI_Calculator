# BMI Calculator

This Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator, developed in Python, is a simple yet powerful tool that showcases my skills in basic programming concepts, user input handling, and arithmetic operations. It allows users to effortlessly determine their BMI based on their height and weight inputs.

As someone passionate about both fitness and programming, I created this project to merge my interests in a meaningful way.
